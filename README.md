# Linked-List-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study about linked list in C++

##**THEORY**:
<p>A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the list. Linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.<br>

1. Insertion: Add a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the linked list.<br>
2. Deletion: Remove a node from the list.<br>
3. Traversal: Visit each node in the linked list.</p>
